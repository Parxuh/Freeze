# Freeze
Freeze is a plugin for Minecraft servers that allows players to freeze and unfreeze players at will.

A frozen player cannot move or look around. 

Players with the "freeze.use" permission can use the /freeze and /unfreeze commands.

Players with the "freeze.notif" permission will be notified when players are frozen and unfrozen.
